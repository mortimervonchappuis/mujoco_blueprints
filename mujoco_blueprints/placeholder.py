"""
Placeholders can be attached to a :class:`mujoco_blueprints.body.Body` to mark prominent locations. They do not appear 
in the resulting xml model and cannot be reconstructed from xml. Is is used to mimic a node in the kinematic 
tree that can be used to specify default attachment locations. If a Thing is attached to a Placeholder it is 
instead attached to the Placeholders parent in a position and orienation as if it would have been attached to 
the Placeholder directly. This can either be used for conveniance if many Things are attached to the same spot 
on the parent Body or in constructing a template with predefined spots for attachment. The following example 
shows how to build the template of a table.

	"""
	This class is available through the shortcut :class:`mujoco_blueprints.Placeholder <Placeholder>`.

	Placeholders can be attached to a :class:`mujoco_blueprints.body.Body` to mark special places and orientations 
	for attachment. It will not be included into the xml.

	Parameters
	----------
	pos : list[int | float] | np.ndarray, optional
		Represents the position of the object. Changing this attribute also changes the properties :attr:`x`, :attr:`y` and :attr:`z`.
	alpha : int | float | None, optional
		(Improper) euler angle of rotation around the x-axis in radian. Changing this value also changes the :attr:`euler` property.
	beta : int | float | None, optional
		(Improper) euler angle of rotation around the y-axis in radian. Changing this value also changes the :attr:`euler` property.
	gamma : int | float | None, optional
		(Improper) euler angle of rotation around the z-axis in radian. Changing this value also changes the :attr:`euler` property.
	name : str | None, optional
		The user specified name of the Body. In the case of a naming conflict the name is appended by an enumeration scheme.
	**kwargs
		Keyword arguments are passed to ``super().__init__``.

	Attributes
	----------
	parent : blue.NodeThingType | None
		When a Thing is attached to the Placeholder, it instead gets attached to the parent and its position 
		and orientation will be adjusted such that it is positioned and oriented as if it were attached of 
		the Placeholder.
