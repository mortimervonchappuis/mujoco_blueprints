class BaseThing(blue.ThingType):

	"""
	BaseThing implements the basic attributes that are used by all Things. 
	
	All Things have certain attributes that are included in the mujoco XML construction. 
	The names of those attributes can be obtained from the :attr:`_MUJOCO_ATTR` property 
	which is dictionary with attribute names as keys and the types their value will have 
	in the Thing instance. If a new Thing class is defined that inherits from BaseThing that 
	introduces new attributes to be written to xml, they can be added by defining a class 
	property ``_NEW_MUJOCO_ATTR`` in the same structure that ``_MUJOCO_ATTR`` is defined.
	``_MUJOCO_ATTR`` then simply aggregates the new additions from ``_NEW_MUJOCO_ATTR``. 
	If a new Thing class inherits a mujoco attribute, that is no longer used, it can be 
	deleted from ``_MUJOCO_ATTR`` by defining it in a class property ``_DEL_MUJOCO_ATTR``, 
	must be a set of the names to be detached.
	
	When a Thing is copied, all attributes needed to reconstruct it are retrieved to create
	a new instance. For this the :attr:`mujoco_blueprints.type.ThingType._BLUEPRINT_ATTR` property is used. New attributes 
	that are feed into the inheriting ``Thing.__init__`` are registered in the class property 
	``_NEW_BLUEPRINTS_ATTR`` and old attributes that are no longer used are registered in 
	``_DEL_BLUEPRINTS_ATTR``. Their structures are analogous to the ``_MUJOCO_ATTR``.
	
	If a Thing gets copied all attributes necessary to instantiate the copy are themselves 
	copied to ensure that the Thing and its copy do not share a reference to the same object
	in any attribute. However, if an attribute is added to :attr:`mujoco_blueprints.type.ThingType._NO_COPY_VALS` it is not 
	copied. New attributes to be excluded from being copied can be added by setting the class
	property ``_NEW_NO_COPY_VALS`` to the classes Type as a set of attribute names.
	
	If a Thing is reconstructed from an xml string, some attribute in the xml tag are not 
	attributes of the Thing class. For example, a geom xml tag will have a type defining
	its shape ``<geom type='sphere'>`` but the corresponding :class:`mujoco_blueprints.geoms.Sphere`
	class specifies the type only implicitly in its name. To retrieve the correct class in
	reconstruction from xml then, those implicit attributes are gathered in the class 
	property :attr:`mujoco_blueprints.type.ThingType._DERIVED_ATTR` to explicitly derived later. Adding new attributes to it
	is done by setting the class property ``_NEW_DERIVED_ATTR`` of the Things Type as a set of attribute 
	names.

	To ensure readability of the resulting xml, attributes that are set to their mujoco 
	defaults are omitted from the xml representations (even though all attributes are set
	in the Thing instance). To check whether an attributes value equals its default, it can
	be obtained from the ``_DEFAULT_VALS`` class property, which is structured as a 
	dictionary of attribute names as keys and their defaults as values. New default values 
	of inheriting classes are added analogously to the previous cases by setting them in a 
	class property ``_NEW_DEFAULT_VALS`` of its Type.
