	"""
	If a Thing has a reference, that potentially points above its parent in the hierarchy of the 
	kinematic tree it becomes a kinematic graph, loosing important properties that are relied on for 
	copying. This class is used to enable migration of attributes that might induce a cycle and to 
	mitigated the introduction of a cycle. The :class:`CyclicalThing` should only be properly attached 
	to one parent, keeping the other references back into the kinematic tree as separate non children 
	attributes (making them improper parents). If a reference of a parent (proper and improper) is 
	performing a copy it should not assign a copy of this instance to its attribute, but instead use 
	the :meth:`_migrate` method. This is used to ensure that this instance is not copied once for each 
	parent.

	Additionally, attributes are restricted from being set to another Thing, if it is not part of the 
	same kinematic tree. This is necessary to prevent exuberant duplications of :math:`c^p` with :math:`c` as the 
	number of copies and :math:`p` as the number of parents (proper and improper).

	If a modification of the kinematic tree results in a parent reference that points outside the 
	kinematic tree, the reference is reset to None.

	The class definition must define two sets ``_PARENT_REFERENCES`` (proper) and ``_OTHER_REFERENCES`` 
	(improper) as class attributes containing the attribute names under which the parents are assigned 
	to the Thing.
